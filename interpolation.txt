RESEARCH FOR BEST INTERPOLATION VALUES

POINTS PER INTERPOLATION:
No noticable impact after fixes

INTERPOLATION LEVELS:

SCHEME = (ghostPointsLevel, singleGhostLevel)
0, 0 -> Not really at all possible to even figure out the gap
4, 0 -> A little bit jittery. More possible than before but still difficult
9, 0 -> breifly can jitter but if not staring, its fine
14, 0 -> can barely see any jitter, would be ideal
24, 0 -> no noticable jitter, can very rarely flicker
49, 0 -> you wouldn't be able to differentiate between this and 24
99, 0 -> feels slightly more accurate than 49

Take away 1 -> you need slightly more than you need to feel like it is more accurate. So, for best 0.001s experience we need more than 49
Take away 2 -> the gaps feel slow to update if the ghost points are not interpolated

99, 4 -> still feels slow to update
99, 49 -> doesn't make a noticable difference

the singleGhostLevel doesn't make any noticable impact on feel

DITHER TESTS:
SCHEME (level)
1 -> no difference between undithered
4 -> seems a little more decisive at times (not much better)
9 -> undithered feels like it jitters between a more consitent range
14 -> still feels unsure of a gap
24 -> causes still increased jitter
49 -> feels worse

Take away 3 -> dither makes the jitter feel worse when getting gap often

dither makes jittering worse even at lower speeds

ON LONGER TRACKS 14 takes a long time to interpolate
