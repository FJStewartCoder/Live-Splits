uint numPoints

for each point:
    uint tStamp
    double x
    double y
    double z


Version 2:

uint8 versionNumber
uint numPoints

iterate each point and get the minimum gap between each point

uint16 minGap

iterate each point again and subtract minGap from each gap
Get the maximum of these gaps
Calculate the smallest number of bytes to store this

uint8 numBytes

for each point:
    (numBytes bytes) tStamp (as time between previous one - minGap)
    float x
    float y
    float z


10,000 points
Samples every 0.25 seconds

V1 -> 8b + (32b * 10000) = 32008b
V2 -> 2b + 8b + 4b + ((2b + 4b + 4b + 4b) * 10000) = 14014b

Assume 50ms out per gap so 200ms minimum. Max gap = 100ms (2b)
